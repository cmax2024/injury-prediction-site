This page presents my DTSC 691 final project, a predictive model that estimates the risk of injury among U.S. Army trainees based on demographic and physical fitness characteristics.

## Project Motivation

Injury prevention is a key priority in military readiness. Using simulated data that reflects real-world patterns in age, gender, and physical performance (measured by the ACFT), this model aims to identify trainees who may be at elevated injury risk.

## Modeling Approach

-   **Target Variable:** Binary indicator of whether a trainee was injured.
-   **Predictors:**
    -   Age (standardized)
    -   Gender
    -   ACFT performance (Pass/Fail)
-   **Model Type:** Binary logistic regression model
-   **Performance Metric:** Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC)

## Results

-   **AUC:** 0.641
-   **Optimal Classification Threshold:** \~0.135
-   **Top predictors:** Age, gender, and failing ACFT
